This web app: The Cage Collection is a website created using React + Vite that features a comprehensive list of all of movies that Nicolas Cage has starred in. Displayed on each movie card is the name of the movie, the movie's runtime, genres, release date, a short description, and a button that links to the external IMDB website.
